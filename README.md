# 📡 TelcoRetentionAI

The complete project documentation was made with mkDocs and is available on the following official [TelcoRetention AI](https://tralencar.github.io/telco_retention_ai/).

**TelcoRetentionAI** is a machine learning project that predicts customer churn for a fictional telecom company using advanced analytics, model optimization, and explainability techniques. It provides interpretable predictions and business insights to help companies reduce churn and prioritize customer retention strategies.

## 🧠 Project Goals

### 🎯 Primary Goal

Build a **binary classification model** to predict if a customer will cancel their service in the next billing cycle.

### 📊 Secondary Goal


Generate business insights and dashboards to highlight:

- Contract type, tech support, billing profile impact
- Demographic and behavioral churn patterns
- Actionable retention strategies for targeted segments

## 🔹 Installing Dependencies

### **1️⃣ Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tralencar/telco_retention_ai.git
cd telco_retention_ai
```

### **2️⃣ Install Poetry (if not installed)**

```bash
pip install poetry
```

### **3️⃣ Set Poetry to create virtual environments inside the project folder**

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

📌 Note:

This will create the .venv/ folder inside the project for better isolation.

### **4️⃣ Activate the virtual environment**

```bash
poetry shell
```

### **5️⃣ Install all dependencies**

```bash
poetry install
```

### 🔹 Setting up Pre-commit

To ensure code quality on each commit, install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

📌 All hooks will run automatically before each commit.

### 🔹 Verifying Installation

Test your environment with:

```bash
poetry run python -c "import pandas; print('Installation successful!')"
```
