# CRISP-DM Methodology in TelcoRetentionAI

The **TelcoRetentionAI** project adopted the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to structure the end-to-end development of a churn prediction solution. Below is a description of each phase as applied to this project.

---

## ðŸ“˜ 1. Business Understanding

The project began with a deep understanding of the telco business problem: **high customer churn**. The strategic goal was to reduce churn rates through **predictive analytics** and **targeted retention actions**.

- **Primary objective**: Predict which customers are likely to cancel their subscription.
- **Secondary objective**: Generate actionable business insights for CRM and marketing campaigns.

---

## ðŸ“Š 2. Data Understanding

The dataset was explored to understand its structure and identify patterns:

- **EDA techniques** like histograms, KDE plots, and boxplots were applied.
- High churn was observed among:
  - Customers with **month-to-month contracts**.
  - Users without **tech support** or **online services**.
  - **Senior citizens** and **users without a partner**.
- Correlations, distributions, and outlier analyses guided feature engineering and business insights.

---

## ðŸ›  3. Data Preparation

In this phase, the dataset was cleaned and transformed:

- **Null values removed** and `TotalCharges` cast to numeric.
- **Categorical features** were encoded using `LabelEncoder`.
- The target variable (`Churn`) was mapped to binary.
- **SMOTE** was applied to balance the target classes.
- **Train-test split** ensured a stratified sampling approach.

---

## ðŸ¤– 4. Modeling

Three classifiers were trained and compared:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting (Best Performer)**

All models were evaluated with:

- `ROC AUC`, `F1-Score`, `Precision`, `Recall`
- Confusion matrices, lift curves, calibration curves, and PR curves.

---

## âœ… 5. Evaluation

The models were assessed both quantitatively and visually:

- **Gradient Boosting** outperformed others in AUC, recall, and calibration.
- **Lift and gain curves** confirmed model stability.
- **SHAP values** were used to interpret predictions.
- **Feature importance** indicated contract type, tenure, and monthly charges as top predictors.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ 6. Deployment / Actionable Insights

While not deployed in production, business-oriented deliverables were created:

- **Dashboards and charts** for decision-makers.
- **Scoring system** to prioritize retention based on churn risk Ã— CLTV.
- **Segmented strategies** targeting:
  - Short-tenure customers
  - Users with no add-on services
  - Tech-savvy users using paperless billing

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

CRISP-DM provided a clear, iterative roadmap to:

- Understand the telco churn problem
- Prepare, model, and evaluate data scientifically
- Deliver **business-driven recommendations**

TelcoRetentionAI stands as a modular, interpretable, and reproducible churn prediction pipeline.
